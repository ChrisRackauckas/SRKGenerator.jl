\begin_layout Title
Stability-Optimized High Order Methods and Stiffness Detection for Pathwise
 Stiff Stochastic Differential Equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Stochastic differential equation (SDE) models of biochemical networks and
 physical phonomena often exhibit large random transitions.
 This property, which we denote as pathwise stiffness, requires that numerical
 integration techniques are stable during these transitions in order to
 give a correct solution.
 However, this limits the allowed stepsize for common fixed timestep explicit
 and drift-implicit integrators, making this problem computationally difficult.
 In this manuscript we propose four separate methods to efficiently handle
 this stiffness.
 First, we develop a novel computational technique to derive strong order
 1.5 stability-optimized explicit adaptive Runge-Kutta methods for stochastic
 differential equations with additive, affine, and diagonal noise.
 Secondly, we define an extension of L-stability to additive noise stochastic
 differential equations and derive two strong order 1.5 adaptive implicit
 methods: a fully-implicit Runge-Kutta (FIRK) method and an extension of
 a deterministic singly-diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) method.
 As a third approach, we developed an adaptive implicit-explicit (IMEX)
 extension of the ESDIRK method and show numerically that it can achieve
 strong order 1.5.
 Lastly, we develop a method for stiffness detection in SDE integrators
 and demonstrate the robustness of the technique.
 These methods are benchmarked against previous methods on a system of 19
 chemical reaction networks and on a discretization of a stochastic reaction-dif
fusion equation to demonstrate efficiency gains between 5x-60x against a
 previous adaptive integrator and show efficiency gains of 
\begin_inset Formula $>300$
\end_inset

x to computationally infeasibility against fixed timestep integrators on
 these problems.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unique features of stochastic models in many cases are pathwise-dependent.
 An ODE model of a chemical reaction network may stay at a constant steady
 state, but in the presence of randomness the trajectories may be switching
 between various steady states.
 These pathwise properties are of interest because they capture effects
 which cannot be found in deterministic models.
 However, these same effects cause numerical difficulties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A minimal example of pathwise stiffness is demonstrated in the equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dX_{t}=\left[-1000X_{t}\left(1-X_{t}\right)\left(2-X_{t}\right)\right]dt+g(t,X_{t})dW_{t},\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace X_{0}=2,\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace t\in\left[0,5\right].\label{eq:pathwise_stiff}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with additive noise 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t,X_{t})=10$
\end_inset

 where a sample trajectory is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pathwise_stiff"

\end_inset

.
 This equation has two stable steady states, one at 
\begin_inset Formula $X=0$
\end_inset

 and another at 
\begin_inset Formula $X=2$
\end_inset

, which the solution switches between when the noise is sufficiently large.
 While near a steady state the derivative is approximately zero making the
 problem non-stiff, during these transitions the derivative of the deterministic
 portion reaches a maximum of 1000.
 This means that in order to be stable, explicit Stochastic Runge-Kutta
 (SRK) must have a small 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 This display of large, transient, and random switching behavior in a given
 trajectory causes stochastic bursts of numerical stiffness, a phenomena
 which we will denote pathwise stiffness.
 The fixed time step Euler-Maruyama method would require 
\begin_inset Formula $dt<10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 to be stable for most trajectories, thus requiring greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times10^{4}$
\end_inset

 steps to solve this 1-dimensional SDE.
 In many cases the switching behavior can be rare (due to smaller amounts
 of noise) or can happen finitely many times like in the multiplicative
 noise version with 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t,X_{t})=10X_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Yet even if these switches are only a small portion of the total time,
 the stability requirement imposed by their existence dominates the computationa
l cost.
 While implicit methods can be used to increase the stability range, this
 can vastly increase the overall computational cost of each step, especially
 in the case large systems of SDEs like discretizations of stochastic reaction-d
iffusion equations.
 In addition, implicit solvers have in practice a smaller stability region
 than the theory due to requiring convergence of the quasi-Newton solvers
 for the implicit steps.
 This problem is mitigated in ODE software by high-quality stage predictors
 given by extrapolation algorithms for good initial conditions for the Newton
 steps 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3790"

\end_inset

.
 However, there are no known algorithms for stage predictors in the presence
 of large noise bursts and thus implicit solvers have a form of instability.
 Thus (we will show) both fixed time step explicit and implicit solvers
 are inadequate for handling this common class of SDEs.

\begin_layout Standard
Since these features exist in the single trajectories of the random processes,
 methods which attempt to account for the presence of such bursts must do
 so on each individual trajectory in order to be efficient.
 In previous work, the authors have shown that by using adaptive time-stepping,
 a stochastic reaction network of 19 reactants is able to be solved with
 an average time step 100,000 times larger than the value that was found
 necessary for stability during the random stiff events for a high order
 SRK method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3787"

\end_inset

.
 This demonstrated that the key to solving these equations efficiently required
 controlling the time steps in a pathwise manner.
 However, the methods were still largely stability-bound, as in the chosen
 tolerances to solve the model were determined by what was necessary for
 stability and was far below the error necessary for the application.
 The purpose of this investigation is to develop numerical methods with
 the ability to better handle pathwise stiffness and allow for efficient
 solving of large Monte Carlo experiments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We approach this problem through four means.
 First, we develop adaptive stability-optimized SRK methods with enlarged
 stability regions.
 This builds off of similar work for ODE integrators which optimize the
 coefficients of a Butcher tableau to give enhanced stability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3514,RN3515,RN3517"

\end_inset

.
 Similar to the Runge-Kutta Chebyschev methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RN3790"

\end_inset

 (and the S-ROCK extension to the stochastic case 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3799,RN3800,RN3801"

\end_inset

), these methods are designed to be efficient for equations which display
 stiffness without fully committing to implicit solvers.
 Given the complexity of the stochastic stability equations and order conditions
, we develop a novel and scalable mechanism for the derivation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

optimal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Runge-Kutta methods.
 We use this method to design stability-optimized methods for additive noise
 and diagonal noise SDEs.
 We show through computational experiments that these adaptive stability-optimiz
ed SRK methods can adequately solve transiently stiff equations without
 losing efficiency in non-stiff problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, to handle extreme stiffness we develop implicit RK methods
 for additive noise SDEs.
 We extend the definition of L-stability to additive noise SDEs and develop
 two strong order 1.5 methods: a fully implicit 2-stage L-stable method and
 an extension of the a well-known L-stable explicit first stage singly diagonall
y implicit RK (ESDIRK) method due to Kennedy and Carpenter which is commonly
 used for convection-diffusion-reaction equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3792"

\end_inset

.
 To the author's knowledge, these are the first high order adaptive L-stable
 methods for SDEs.
 In addition, to extend the utility of these additive noise methods, we
 derive an extension of the methods for additive SDEs to affine SDEs (mixed
 multiplicative and additive noise terms) through a Lamperti transformation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3525"

\end_inset

.
 Lastly, in order to handle extreme transient stiffness, for each of these
 types of methods we derive computationally cheap methods for detecting
 stiffness and switching between implicit and explicit integrators in the
 presence of stiffness.
 We show that these methods can robustly detect pathwise stiff transients
 and thus can serve as the basis for automatic switching methods for SDEs.
 Together we test on non-stiff, semi-stiff, and stiff equations with 2 to

Take stochastic differential equations of the general form:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dX_{t}=f(t,X_{t})dt+g(t,X_{t})dW_{t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-dimensional vector, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 is the drift coefficient and 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\mathbb{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{d\times m}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix equation known as the diffusion coefficient which describes
 the amount and mixtures of the noise process 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}$
\end_inset

 which is a 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-dimensional Brownian motion.
 In many models, noise is added to deterministic equations phenomenologically.
 These models are numerically simulated for their qualitative behavior:
 scientists are interested not in their high accuracy numerical predictions
 but to understand the general phenomena which only occurs in the presence
 of stochasticity, like random switching between cell types.
 In these cases, the noise process can be modeled as exogenous to the system
 and thus not dependent the system itself, leading to the assumption that
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t,X_{t})\equiv g(t)$
\end_inset

 which is known as additive noise.
 Another common case is multiplicative noise, where to each deterministic
 equation a noise term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}X_{t}^{i}dW_{t}$
\end_inset

 is added to give proportional amounts of randomness added to the dynamics.
 This results in 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t,X_{t})$
\end_inset

 being the diagonal matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{i}X_{t}^{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 and thus falls into the more general category of diagonal noise.

 The diagonal noise methods utilize the same general form and order conditions

 In the case of additive noise, this reduces to the form

X_{n+1}=X_{n}+\sum_{i=1}^{s}\alpha_{i}f\left(t_{n}+c_{i}^{(0)}h,H_{i}^{(0)}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{s}\left(\beta_{i}^{(1)}I_{(1)}+\beta_{i}^{(2)}\frac{I_{(1,0)}}{h}\right)g\left(t_{n}+c_{i}^{(1)}h\right)\label{eq:add_update}

\end_inset

 The tuple of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A^{(j)},B^{(j)},\beta^{(j)},\alpha\right)$

 These coefficients must satisfy the constraint equations described in Appendix

The additive SRK method can be written as
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}^{h}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e=\left(1,1,1,1\right)^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 By substitution we receive
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{n+1}^{h}=X_{n}^{h}\left(1+z\left(\alpha\cdot\left(I-zA^{(0)}\right)^{-1}\right)\right)+\left(I-zA^{(0)}\right)^{-1}B^{(0)}e\sigma\frac{I_{(1,0)}}{h}+\beta^{(1)}\sigma I_{(1)}+\sigma\beta^{(2)}\frac{I_{(1,0)}}{h}\label{eq:SRK_stab_sub}

This set of equations decouples since the iterated stochastic integral approxima
tion 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{j}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}^{h}$

 Thus the stability condition is determined by the equation

G(z)=1+z\alpha\cdot\left(I-zA^{(0)}\right)^{-1}\label{eq:SRA_stab}

 Thus the stability properties of the deterministic Runge-Kutta methods
 carry over to the additive noise SRA methods on this test equation.
 However, most two-stage tableaus from ODE research were developed to satisfy
 higher order ODE order constraints which do not apply.
 Thus we will instead look to maximize stability while satisfying the stochastic
 order constraints.

For explicit methods,

\end_inset

 are lower diagonal and we receive the simplified stability function 
\begin_inset Formula

G(z)=1+A_{21}z^{2}\alpha_{2}+z\left(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\right)\label{eq:SRA_stab_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for a two-stage additive noise SRK method.
 For this method we will find the method which optimizes the stability in
 the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we wish to find 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 the negative real roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G(z)\right|=1$
\end_inset

 are minimized.
 By the quadratic equation we see that there exists only a single negative
 root: 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\frac{1-\sqrt{1+8\alpha_{2}}}{2\alpha_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Using Mathematica's minimum function, we determine that the minimum value
 for this root subject to the order constraints is 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\frac{3}{4}\left(1-\sqrt{\frac{19}{3}}\right)\approx-1.13746$
\end_inset

.
 This is achieved when 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

, meaning that the SRA1 method due to Rossler achieves the maximum stability
 criteria.
 However, given extra degrees of freedom, we attempted to impose that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}^{(0)}=c_{1}^{(1)}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}^{(0)}=c_{2}^{(1)}=1$
\end_inset

 so that the error estimator spans the whole interval.
 This can lead to improved robustness of the adaptive error estimator.
 In fact, when trying to optimize the error estimator's span we find that
 there is no error estimator which satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}^{(0)}>\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

 which is the span of the SRA1 method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Thus SRA1 is the stability-optimized 2-stage explicit method which achieves
 the most robust error estimator.

Stability-Optimal 3-Stage Explicit SRA Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the 3-stage SRA method, we receive the simplified stability function
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G(z)=A_{21}A_{31}\alpha_{3}z^{3}+A_{21}\alpha_{2}z^{2}+A_{31}\alpha_{3}z^{2}+A_{32}\alpha_{3}z^{2}+\alpha_{1}z+\alpha_{2}z+\alpha_{3}z+1\label{eq:SRA_stab_3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 To optimize this method, we attempted to use the same techniques as before
 and optimize the real values of the negative roots.
 However, in this case we have a cubic polynomial and the root equations
 are more difficult.
 Instead, we turn to a more general technique to handle the stability optimizati
on which will be employed in later sections as well.
 To do so, we generate an optimization problem which we can numerically
 solve for the coefficients.
 To simplify the problem, we let 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and define the function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f\left(z,w;N,M\right)=\int_{D}\chi_{G(z)\leq1}(z)dz\label{eq:SRA_integral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the area of the stability region when 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large.
 Thus we define the stability-optimized SRK method for additive noise SDEs
 as the set of coefficients which achieves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\max_{A^{(i)},B^{(i)},\beta^{(i)},\alpha} & f(z)\label{eq:SRA_maximize}\\
\text{subject to: } & \text{Order Constraints}\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

In all cases we impose 
\begin_inset Formula $0<c_{i}^{(0)},c_{i}^{(1)}<1$
\end_inset

.
 We use the order constraints to simplify the problem to a nonlinear optimizatio
n problem on 14 variables with 3 equality constraints and 4 inequality constrain
ts (with bound constraints on the 10 variables).
 However, we found that simplifying the problem even more to require 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}^{(0)}=c_{1}^{(1)}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{3}^{(0)}=c_{3}^{(1)}=1$
\end_inset

 did not significantly impact the stability regions but helps the error
 estimator and thus we reduced the problem to 10 variables, 3 equality constrain
ts, and 2 inequality constraints.
 This was optimized using the COBYLA local optimization algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3788,RN3789"

\end_inset

 with randomized initial conditions 100 times and all gave similar results.
 In the Mathematica notebook we show the effect of changing the numerical
 integration region 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 on the results, but conclude that a 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 which does not bias the result for better/worse real/complex handling does
 not improve the result.
 The resulting algorithm, SOSRA, we given by the coefficients in table in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:SOSRA"

\end_inset

.
 Lastly, we used the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}^{(0)}=c_{3}^{(0)}=c_{2}^{(1)}=c_{3}^{(1)}=1$
\end_inset

 to allow for free stability detection (discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:StabilityDetection"

\end_inset

).
 The method generated with this extra constraint is SOSRA2 whose coefficients
 are in the table in Section

.
 These methods have their stability regions compared to SRA1 and SRA3 in

\begin_layout Subsection
Drift Implicit Methods for Stiff SDEs with Additive Noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
An L-Stable 2-Stage (Semi-)Implicit SRA Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's clear that, as in the case for deterministic equations, the explicit
 methods cannot be made A-stable.
 However, the implicit two-stage additive noise SRK method is determined
 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G(z)=\frac{z(A_{11}(A_{22}z-\alpha_{2}z-1)+A_{12}z(\alpha_{1}-A_{21})+A_{21}\ensuremath{\alpha_{2}}z-A_{22}(\alpha_{1}z+1)+\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2})+1}{A_{11}z(A_{22}z-1)-z(A_{12}A_{21}z+A_{22})+1}\label{eq:SRA_stab2_implicit}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

-stable if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A_{11}z(A_{22}z-1)-z(A_{12}A_{21}z+A_{22})+1>z(A_{11}(A_{22}z-\alpha_{2}z-1)+A_{12}z(\alpha_{1}-A_{21})+A_{21}\ensuremath{\alpha_{2}}z-A_{22}(\alpha_{1}z+1)+\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2})+1.\label{eq:SRA_stab2_ineq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Notice that the numerator equals the denominator if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 or
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
z=\frac{\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}}{\left(A_{22}-A_{12}\right)\alpha_{1}+\left(A_{11}-A_{21}\right)\alpha_{2}}.\label{eq:SRA_stab2_z}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the order conditions we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=1$
\end_inset

 which means that no root exists with 
\begin_inset Formula $Re(z)<0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A_{22}-A_{12}\right)\alpha_{1}+\left(A_{11}-A_{21}\right)\alpha_{2}>0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus under these no roots conditions, we can determine A-stability by checking
 the inequality at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1$
\end_inset

, which gives 
\begin_inset Formula $1>\left(A_{22}-A_{12}\right)\alpha_{1}+\left(A_{11}-A_{21}\right)\alpha_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the order condition, we have a total of four constraints on the 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left(A_{11}+A_{12}\right)\alpha_{1}+\left(A_{21}+A_{22}\right)\alpha_{2} & =\frac{1}{2}\label{eq:SRA_stab2_conds}\\
\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2} & =1\nonumber \\
0<\left(A_{22}-A_{12}\right)\alpha_{1}+\left(A_{11}-A_{21}\right)\alpha_{2} & <1\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

However, A-stability is not sufficient for most ODE integrators to properly
 handle stiff equations and thus extra properties generally imposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3790"

\end_inset

.
 One important property we wish to extend to stochastic integrators is L-stabili
ty.
 The straightforward extension of L-stability is the condition
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{z\rightarrow\infty}G(z)=0.\label{eq:SRA_L}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This implies that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{-A_{11}A_{22}+A_{11}\alpha_{2}+A_{12}A_{21}-A_{12}\alpha_{1}-A_{21}\alpha_{2}+A_{22}\alpha_{2}\alpha_{1}}{A_{12}A_{21}-A_{11}A_{22}}=0\label{eq:SRA_Lcond}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The denominator is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\det(A^{(0)})$
\end_inset

 which implies 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 must be non-singular.
 Next, we attempt to impose B-stability on the drift portion of the method.
 We use the condition due to Burrage and Butcher that for 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\text{diag}\left(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $M=BA^{(0)}+A^{(0)}B-\alpha\alpha^{T}$
\end_inset

 (for ODEs) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3791"

\end_inset

, we require both 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 to be non-negative definite.
 However, in the supplemental Mathematica notebooks we show computationally
 that there is no 2-stage SRK method of this form which satisfies all three
 of these stability conditions.
 Thus we settle for A-stability and L-stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recalling that 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 are the locations in time where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 are approximated respectively, we wish to impose
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
c_{1}^{(0)} & =0\label{eq:SRA_ccond}\\
c_{2}^{(0)} & =1\nonumber \\
c_{1}^{(1)} & =0\nonumber \\
c_{2}^{(1)} & =1\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

 so that the error estimator covers the entire interval of integration.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{(0)}=A^{(0)}e$
\end_inset

, this leads to the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{21}+A_{22}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Using the constraint-satisfaction algorithm FindInstance in Mathematica,
 we look for tableaus which satisfy the previous conditions with the added
 constraint of semi-implicitness, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 is lower triangular.
 This assumption is added because the inverse of the normal distribution
 has unbounded moments, and thus in many cases it mathematically simpler
 to consider the diffusion term as explicit (though there are recent methods
 which drop this requirement via truncation or extra assumptions on the
 solution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3806"

\end_inset

).
 However, we find that there is no coefficient set which meets all of these
 requirements.
 However, if we relax the interval estimate condition to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq c_{2}^{(0)}\leq1$
\end_inset

, we find an A-L stable method:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
A^{(0)} & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & \frac{-41}{64}\\
\frac{32}{41} & \frac{9}{41}
\end{array}\right),\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace B^{(0)}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{5}{8} & 0\\
0 & \frac{7}{3}
\end{array}\right),\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\alpha=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{32}{41}\\
\frac{9}{41}
\end{array}\right)\label{eq:LSRA}\\
\beta^{(1)} & =\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1
\end{array}\right),\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\beta^{(2)}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
-1
\end{array}\right),\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace c^{(0)}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{23}{64}\\
1
\end{array}\right),\,\,\,c^{(1)}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1
\end{array}\right)\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

which we denote LSRA.
 If we attempt to look for a 2-stage SDIRK-like method to reduce the complexity
 of the implicit equation, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{12}^{(0)}=0$
\end_inset

, using FindInstance we find the constraints unsatisfiable.
 Note that if we drop the semi-implicit assumption we find that the full
 constraints cannot be satisfied there (we still cannot satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}^{(0)}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}^{(0)}=1$
\end_inset

), and there does not exist a 2-stage A-L stable SDIRK method in that case.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extensions of ODE Implicit Runge-Kutta Methods to Implicit SRA Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the stability region of the SRA methods is completely determined by
 the deterministic portion 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, in some cases there may exist a sensible extension of implicit Runge-Kutta
 methods for ordinary differential equations to high order adaptive methods
 stochastic differential equations with additive noise which keep the same
 stability properties.
 Since the order constraints which only involve the deterministic portions
 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 match the conditions required for ODE integrators, existence is dependent
 on finding 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{(1)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{(2)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{(1)}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 that satisfy the full order constraints.
 In this case, an adaptive error estimator can be added by using the same
 estimator as the ODE method (which we call 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{D}$
\end_inset

) but adding the absolute size of the stochastic portions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{N}=\left|\sum_{i=1}^{s}\left(\beta_{i}^{(1)}I_{(1)}+\beta_{i}^{(2)}\frac{I_{(1,0)}}{h}\right)\right|\label{eq:EN}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 leading to the error estimator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E=\delta E_{D}+E_{N}.\label{eq:E}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This can be shown similarly to the construction in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3787"

\end_inset

.
 Given the large literature on implicit RK methods for ODEs, this presents
 a large pool of possibly good methods and heuristically one may believe
 that these would do very well in the case of small noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we note that there does not always exist such an extension.
 Using the constraint-satisfaction algorithm FindInstance in Mathematica,
 we looked for extensions of the explicit first stage singly-diagonally
 implicit RK (ESDIRK) method TRBDF2 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and could not find values satisfying the constraints.
 In addition, we could not find values for an extension of the 5th order
 Radau IIA method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 which satisfies the constraints.
 In fact, our computational search could not find any extension of a 3-stage
 L-stable implicit RK method which satisfies the constraints.

(E)SDIRK methods are particularly interesting because these methods can
 be solved using a single factorization of the function of the Jacobian
 
\begin_inset Formula $I-\gamma dtJ$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 is the Jacobian.
 Additionally, explicit handling of the noise term is similar to the Implicit-Ex
plicit (IMEX) form for additive Runge-Kutta methods in that it occurs by
 adding a single constant term to the Newton iterations in each stage, meaning
 it does not significantly increase the computational cost.
 The chosen ESDIRK method has a complimentary explicit tableau to form an
 IMEX additive Runge-Kutta method, and the chosen values for the stochastic
 portions are simultaneously compatible with the order conditions for this
 tableau.
 In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Convergence-Tests"

\end_inset

 we numerically investigate the order of the IMEX extension of the method
 and show that it matches the convergence of the other SRA methods on the
 test equation.
 One thing to note is that since the problem is additive noise the method
 is never implicit in the dependent variables in the noise part, so in theory
 this can also be extended with 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 implicit as well (with convergence concerns due to the non-finite inverse
 moments of the Normal distribution

\begin_layout Section
Optimized-Stability Methods for Affine Noise via Transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the efficiency of the methods for additive noise, one method for developin
g efficient methods for more general noise processes is to use a transform
 of diagonal noise processes to additive noise.
 This transform is due to Lamperti 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which states that the SDE of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dX_{t}=f(t,X_{t})dt+\sigma(t,X_{t})R(t)dW_{t}\label{eq:Lamperti}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>0$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}(t,X_{i,t})$
\end_inset

 has the transformation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z_{i,t}=\psi_{i}(t,X_{i,t})=\int\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}(x,t)}dx\mid_{x=X_{i,t}}\label{eq:LampertiIntegral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which will result in an Ito process with the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th element given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dZ_{i,t}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi_{i}(t,x)\mid_{x=\psi^{-1}(t,Z_{i,t})}+\frac{f_{i}(t,\psi^{-1}(t,Z_{t}))}{\sigma_{i}\left(t,\psi_{i}^{-1}\left(t,Z_{i,t}\right)\right)}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\sigma_{i}\left(t,\psi_{i}^{-1}\left(t,Z_{i,t}\right)\right)\right)dt+\sum_{j=1}^{n}r_{ij}(t)dw_{j,t}\label{eq:LampertiTransform}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{t}=\psi^{-1}\left(t,Z_{t}\right).\label{eq:LampertiInv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is easily verified using Ito's Lemma.
 In the case of mixed multiplicative and additive noise (affine noise),
 the vector equation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dX_{t}=f(t,X_{t})dt+\left(\sigma_{M}X_{t}+\sigma_{A}\right)dW_{t}\label{eq:LampertiAffine}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{M}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}>0$
\end_inset

, the transform becomes element-wise in the system.
 Thus we can consider the one-dimensional case.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t,X_{t})=\int\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_{M}X_{t}+\sigma_{A}}\right)dx\mid_{x=X_{t}}=\frac{\log(\sigma_{M}X_{t}+\sigma_{A})}{\sigma_{M}}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}=\frac{\exp\left(\sigma_{M}Z_{t}\right)-\sigma_{A}}{\sigma_{M}}$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
dZ_{t} & =\tilde{f}(t,X_{t})dt+dW_{t}\label{eq:LampertiAffineSol}\\
\tilde{f}(t,X_{t}) & =\frac{f(t,X_{t})}{\sigma_{M}X_{t}+\sigma_{A}}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{M}\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

provided 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{M}X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is guaranteed to be sufficiently different from 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}$
\end_inset

 to not cause definitional issues.
 It is common in biological models like chemical reaction networks that
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}\geq0$
\end_inset

, in which case this is well-defined for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}>0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{M}>0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For numerical problem solving environments (PSEs), one can make use of this
 transformation in two ways.
 Source transformations could transform affine noise SDEs element-wise to
 solve for the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{t}$
\end_inset

 which is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{M}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and is the transformed 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 otherwise (assuming parameters must be positive).
 When doing so, references of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i,t}$
\end_inset

 must be changed into 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\exp(\sigma_{M}Z_{i,t})-\sigma_{A}}{\sigma_{M}}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the affine noise Lotka-Volterra SDE:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
dx & =\left(ax-bxy\right)dt+\left(\sigma_{M}x+\sigma_{A}\right)dW_{t}^{1}\\
dy & =\left(-cy+dxy\right)dt+\sigma_{\tilde{A}}dW_{t}^{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 only has noise on the first term, so this transforms to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x & =\frac{\exp(\sigma_{M}z)-\sigma_{A}}{\sigma_{M}}\\
dz & =\left(\frac{ax-bxy}{\sigma_{M}x+\sigma_{A}}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{M}\right)dt+dW_{t}^{1}\\
dy & =\left(-cy+dxy\right)dt+\sigma_{\tilde{A}}dW_{t}^{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

along with the change to the initial condition and can thus be solved with
 the SRA methods.
 We note a word of caution that the above transformation only holds when
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}>0$
\end_inset

 and when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}=0$
\end_inset

, the transformation is different, with 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}=\frac{\exp\left(Z_{t}\right)}{\sigma_{M}}$
\end_inset

 (instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\exp\left(\sigma_{M}Z_{t}\right)}{\sigma_{M}}$
\end_inset

 which one would get by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}=0$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of performing the transformations directly on the functions themselves,
 we can modify the SRA algorithm to handle this case as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{n+1}=\psi^{-1}\left(\psi\left(X_{n}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{s}\alpha_{i}\tilde{f}\left(t_{n}+c_{i}^{(0)}h,H_{i}^{(0)}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{s}\left(\beta_{i}^{(1)}I_{(1)}+\beta_{i}^{(2)}\frac{I_{(1,0)}}{h}\right)\tilde{g}\left(t_{n}+c_{i}^{(1)}h\right)\right)\label{eq:AffineStep}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with stages
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{i}^{(0)}=\psi\left(X_{n}\right)+\sum_{j=1}^{s}A_{ij}^{(0)}\tilde{f}\left(t_{n}+c_{j}^{(0)}h,H_{j}^{(0)}\right)h+\sum_{j=1}^{s}B_{ij}^{(0)}\tilde{g}\left(t_{n}+c_{j}^{(1)}h\right)\frac{I_{(1,0)}}{h}\label{eq:AffineStep2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the element-wise function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi_{i}(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{\log(\sigma_{i,M}x+\sigma_{i,A})}{\sigma_{i,M}} & \sigma_{i,M}>0,\sigma_{i,A}>0\\
\frac{\log(x)}{\sigma_{i,M}} & \sigma_{i,M}>0,\sigma_{i,A}=0\\
x & o.w.
\end{cases},\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\psi_{i}^{-1}(z)=\begin{cases}
\frac{\exp\left(\sigma_{i,M}z\right)}{\sigma_{i,M}} & \sigma_{i,M}>0,\sigma_{i,A}>0\\
\frac{\exp\left(z\right)}{\sigma_{i,M}} & \sigma_{i,M}>0,\sigma_{i,A}=0\\
x & o.w.
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}_{i}(t)=\begin{cases}
1 & \sigma_{i,M}>0\\
\sigma_{i,A} & o.w.
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

 This can be summarized as performing all internal operations in 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-space (where the equation is additive) but saving each step in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

-space.

In this space, 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is the stability variable for the drift term and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is the stability in the diffusion term.
 Under this scaling 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(h,\sqrt{h}\right)$

 on the coefficients of the SRK method where mean-square stability is achieved
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|S(z,w)\right|<1$

 Determination of the stability equation for the implicit methods was found
 to be computationally intractable and is an avenue for further research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
An Optimization Problem for Determination of Coefficients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to determine the coefficients for the diagonal SRK methods which
 optimize the stability.
 To do so, we generate an optimization problem which we can numerically
 solve for the coefficients.
 To simplify the problem, we let 
\begin_inset Formula $z,w\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Define the function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f\left(z,w;N,M\right)=\int_{-M}^{M}\int_{-N}^{1}\chi_{S(z,w)\leq1}(z,w)dzdw.\label{eq:SRIarea}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Notice that for 
\begin_inset Formula $N,M\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the area of the stability region.
 Thus we define the stability-optimized diagonal SRK method as the set of
 coefficients which achieves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\max_{A^{(i)},B^{(i)},\beta^{(i)},\alpha} & f(z,w)\label{eq:opt}\\
\text{subject to: } & \text{Order Constraints}\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

 However, like with the SRK methods for additive noise, we impose a few
 extra constraints to add robustness to the error estimator.
 In all cases we impose 
\begin_inset Formula $0<c_{i}^{(0)},c_{i}^{(1)}<1$
\end_inset

 .
 Additionally we can prescribe 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{4}^{(0)}=c_{4}^{(1)}=1$
\end_inset

 which we call the End-C Constraint.
 Lastly, we can prescribe the ordering constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}^{(j)}<c_{2}^{(j)}<c_{3}^{(j)}<c_{4}^{(j)}$
\end_inset

 which we denote as the Inequality-C Constraint.

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting problem is a nonlinear programming problem with 44 variables

 To numerically approximate this function, we calculated the characteristic
 function on a grid with even spacing 
\begin_inset Formula $dx$

 using the JuMP framework

 were used to approximate the optimality of solutions.
 The optimization was run many times in parallel until many results produced
 methods with similar optimality, indicating that we likely obtained values
 near the true minimum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 are the bounds on the stability region and also represent a trade-off between
 the stability in the drift and the stability in the diffusion.
 A method which is optimized when 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is small would be highly stable in the case of small noise, but would not
 be guaranteed to have good stability properties in the presence of large
 noise.
 Thus these parameters are knobs for tuning the algorithms for specific
 situations, and thus we solved the problem for different combinations of
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 to determine different algorithms for the different cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Resulting Approximately-Optimal Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coefficients generated for approximately-optimal methods fall into three
 categories.
 In one category we have the drift-dominated stability methods where large
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and small 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 was optimized.
 On the other end we have the diffusion-dominated stability methods where
 large 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and small 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 was optimized.
 Then we have the mixed stability methods which used some mixed size choices
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 As a baseline, we optimized the objective without constraints on the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 to see what the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best possible method
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be.
 When this was done with large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, the resulting method, which we name SOSRI, has almost every value of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 satisfy the constraints, but with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}^{(0)}\approx-0.04$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{4}^{(0)}\approx3.75$
\end_inset

.
 To see if we could produce methods which were more diffusion-stable, we
 decreased 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 to optimize more in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 but failed to produce methods with substantially enlarged diffusion-stability
 over SOSRI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding only the inequality constraints on the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and looking for methods for drift-dominated stability, we failed to produce
 methods whose 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 estimators adequately covered the interval.
 Some of the results did produce stability regions similar to SOSRI but
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}^{(0)}<0.5$
\end_inset

 which indicates the method could have problems with error estimation.
 When placing the equality constraints on the edge 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

, one method, which we label SOSRI2, resulted in similar stability to SOSRI
 but satisfy the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 constraints.
 In addition, this method satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{3}^{(0)}=c_{4}^{(0)}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{3}^{(1)}=c_{4}^{(1)}=1$
\end_inset

, a property whose use will be explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:StabilityDetection"

\end_inset

.
 The stability regions for these methods is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SOSRI-Stability-Regions."

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To look for more diffusion-stable methods, we dropped to 
\begin_inset Formula $N=6$
\end_inset

 to encourage the methods to expand the stability in the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

-plane.
 However, we could not find a method whose stability region went substantially
 beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[-2,2\right]$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 This was further decreased to 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset

 where methods still could not go substantially beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|2\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we were not able to obtain methods optimized for the diffusion-dominated
 case.
 This hard barrier was hit under many different constraint and objective
 setups and under thousands of optimization runs, indicating there might
 be a diffusion-stability barrier for explicit methods.

\begin_layout Standard
In many real-world cases, one may not be able to clearly identify a model
 as drift-stability bound or diffusion-stability bound, or if the equation
 is stiff or non-stiff.
 In fact, many models may switch between such extremes.
 An example is a model with stochastic switching between different steady
 states.
 In this case, we have that the diffusion term 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t,X_{ss})\approx0$
\end_inset

 in the area of many stochastic steady states, meaning that while straddling
 a steady state the integration is heavily diffusion-stability dominated
 and usually non-stiff.
 However, when switching between steady states, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can be very large and stiff, causing the integration to be heavily drift-stabil
ity dominated.
 Since these switches are random, the ability to adapt between these two
 behaviors could be key to achieving optimal performance.
 Given the trade-off, we investigated how our methods allow for switching
 between methods which optimize for the different situations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basis for our method is an extension of a method proposed for deterministic
 differential equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3527,RN3526,RN3790"

\end_inset

.
 The idea is to create a cheap approximation to the dominant eigenvalues
 of the Jacobians for the drift and diffusion terms.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the eigenvector of the respective Jacobian, then for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert v\Vert$
\end_inset

 sufficiently small,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\lambda_{D}\right|\approx\frac{\Vert f(t,x+v)-f(t,x)\Vert}{\Vert v\Vert},\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\left|\lambda_{N}\right|\approx\frac{\Vert g(t,x+v)-g(t,x)\Vert}{\Vert v\Vert}\label{eq:eigen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda_{D}\right|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda_{N}\right|$
\end_inset

 are the estimates of the dominant eigenvalues for the deterministic and
 noise functions respectively.
 We have in approximation that 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{i}^{(k)}$
\end_inset

 is an approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t+c_{i}^{(k)}h}$
\end_inset

 and thus the difference between two successive approximations at the same
 time-point, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}^{(k)}=c_{j}^{(k)}$
\end_inset

, then the following serves as a local Jacobian estimate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\lambda_{D}\right|\approx\frac{\Vert f(t+c_{i}^{(0)}h,H_{i}^{(0)})-f(t+c_{j}^{(0)}h,H_{j}^{(0)})\Vert}{\Vert H_{i}^{(0)}-H_{j}^{(0)}\Vert},\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\left|\lambda_{N}\right|\approx\frac{\Vert f(t+c_{i}^{(1)}h,H_{i}^{(1)})-f(t+c_{j}^{(1)}h,H_{j}^{(1)})\Vert}{\Vert H_{i}^{(1)}-H_{j}^{(1)}\Vert}\label{eq:local_eigen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If we had already computed a successful step, we would like to know if
 in the next calculation we should switch methods due to stability.
 Thus it makes sense to approximate the Jacobian at the end of the interval,
 meaning 
\begin_inset Formula $i=s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j=s-1$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the number of stages.
 Then if 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{min}$
\end_inset

 is the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is in the stability region for the method, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{h\left|\lambda_{D}\right|}{z_{min}}>1$
\end_inset

 when the steps are outside the stability region.
 Because the drift and mixed stability methods do not track the noise axis
 directly, we instead modify 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{min}$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

 of the maximum of the stability region in the noise axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hairer noted that, for ODEs, if a RK method has

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}=f(t+c_{i}h,g_{i})$
\end_inset

 is an estimate of the eigenvalues for the Jacobian of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Given the construction of SOSRI2, a natural extension is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|\lambda_{D}\right|\approx\frac{\Vert f\left(t_{n}+c_{4}^{(0)}h,H_{4}^{(0)}\right)-f\left(t_{n}+c_{3}^{(0)}h,H_{3}^{(0)}\right)\Vert}{\Vert H_{4}^{(0)}-H_{3}^{(0)}\Vert},\thinspace\thinspace\thinspace\left|\lambda_{N}\right|\approx\frac{\Vert g\left(t_{n}+c_{4}^{(0)}h,H_{4}^{(1)}\right)-g\left(t_{n}+c_{3}^{(0)}h,H_{3}^{(1)}\right)\Vert}{\Vert H_{4}^{(1)}-H_{3}^{(1)}\Vert}\label{eq:sriopt2_eigen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Given that these values are all part of the actual step calculations, this
 stiffness estimate essentially is free.
 By comparing these values to the stability plot in Figure

The denominator is chosen as a reasonable box approximation to the edge
 of the stability region.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is a safety factor: in theory 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 since we divided by the edge of the stability region, but in practice this
 is only an eigenvalue estimate and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 allows for a trade-off between the false positive and false negative rates.
 If either of those conditions are satisfied, then 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is constrained by the stability region.
 The solver can thus alert the user that the problem is stiff or use this
 estimate to switch to a method more suitable for stiff equations.
 In addition, the error estimator gives separate error estimates in the
 drift and diffusion terms.
 A scheme could combine these two facts to develop a more robust stiffness
 detection method, and label the stiffness as either drift or diffusion
 dominated.

 and, employing a similar method as the deterministic case, check for stiffness
 via the estimate

In addition, stiff solvers can measure the maximal eigenvalues directly
 from the Jacobian.
 Here we suggest the measure from Shampine

 of using 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vert J\Vert_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 as a cheap upper bound.
 For semi-implicit methods like LSRA we only get a stability bound on the
 drift term, but this should be sufficient since for additive noise diffusive
 noise instability is not an issue.

\end_inset

).
 We tested the error and timing on Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ex3"

\end_inset

.
 In addition, we tested using the Lotka-Volterra equation with additive
 noise:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
dx & =\left(ax-bxy\right)dt+\sigma_{A}dW_{t}^{1}\nonumber \\
dy & =\left(-cy+dxy\right)dt+\sigma_{A}dW_{t}^{2}\label{eq:lotka_add}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $b=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c=3.0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1.0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{A}=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:lotka_add"

\end_inset

 does not have an analytical solution, a reference solution was computed
 using a low tolerance solution via SOSRA for each Brownian trajectory.
 The plots show that there is a minimal difference in efficiency between
 the SRA algorithms for errors in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[10^{-6},10^{-2}\right]$
\end_inset

, while these algorithms are all significantly more efficient than the Euler-Mar
uyama method when the required error is 
\begin_inset Formula $<10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SOSRA-efficiency"

\end_inset

).
 The weak error work-precision diagrams show that when using between 100
 to 10,000 trajectories, the weak error is less than the sample error in
 the regime where there is no discernible efficiency difference between
 the SRA methods.
 These results show that in the regime of mild accuracy on non-stiff equations,
 the SOSRA, SOSRA2, and SKenCarp methods are much more efficient than low
 order methods yet achieve the same efficiency as the non-stability optimized
 SRA variants.
 Note that these results also show that the error estimator for adaptivity
 is highly conservative, generating solutions with around 2 orders of magnitude
 less error than the tolerance suggests.

To test how efficiently the algorithms could achieve solve semi-stiff equations,
 we chose to analyze the qualitative results of the driven Van der Pol equation.
 The driven Van der Pol equation is given by the system:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
dy & =μ((1-x^{2})y-x)dt\nonumber \\
dx & =ydt\label{eq:van_der_pol}
\end{align}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is the driving factor.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 increases the equation becomes more stiff.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 is a common test for stiff ODE solvers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3794"

\end_inset

, with lower values used to test the semi-stiff regime for ODEs.
 For our purposes, we chose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=10^{5}$
\end_inset

 as a semi-stiff test case.
 The ODE case, solved using the Tsit5 explicit Runge-Kutta algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3523,RN3784"

\end_inset

, and demonstrates the mild stiffness which is still well-handled by explicit
 methods (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AdditiveVanDerPol"

\end_inset

A).
 We extend this model to the driven Van der Pol model with additive noise:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
dy & =μ((1-x^{2})y-x)dt+\rho dW_{t}^{(1)}\nonumber \\
dx & =y+\rho dW_{t}^{(2)}\label{eq:van_der_pol_add}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=3.0$
\end_inset

 is the noise gain and 
\begin_inset Formula $dW^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dW^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 are independent Brownian motions.
 The solution to this model is interesting because it gives the same qualitative
 behavior, large bursts when 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 crosses zero, but in this case the zero crossings are stochastic.
 Even at high tolerances, (
\begin_inset Formula $abstol=10$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $reltol=1/2^{1}$
\end_inset

), SOSRA is able to reproduce this qualitative behavior of the low tolerance
 solutions (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AdditiveVanDerPol"

\end_inset

B), and SOSRA2 producing similar results at the same tolerances a factor
 of two lower.
 Given the conservativeness of the error estimators shown in previous (and
 other tests), this case corresponds to roughly two decimal places of accuracy,
 which is more than sufficient for many phenomenological models.
 However, even at tolerances of 
\begin_inset Formula $abstol=1/2^{3}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $reltol=1/2^{3}$
\end_inset

 SRA3 was unable to reproduce the correct qualitative behavior (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AdditiveVanDerPol"

\end_inset

C).
 Thus we decreased the tolerances by factors of 2 until it was able to reproduce
 the correct qualitative results (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AdditiveVanDerPol"

\end_inset

D).
 This shows that the SOSRA are more reliable on models with transient stiffness.
 To test the impact on the run time of the algorithms, each of the algorithms
 were run 100 times with the tolerance setup that allows them to most efficientl
y generate correct qualitative results.
 The run times are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SRA-Runtimes-on-Van"

\end_inset

, which show that SRA1 takes more than 60 times and SRA3 nearly 20 times
 as long as the SOSRA methods.
 In this case the implicit method SKenCarp is the fastest by besting the
 SOSRA methods by 2x while achieving similar qualitative results.
 This shows that as stiffness comes into play, the SOSRA methods along with
 the implicit SKenCarp method are more robust and efficient.
 We note that we attempted to solve the equations using a fixed time step
 implicit method as well (implicit Euler-Maruyama), though during the zero-cross
ing events the quasi-Newton steps would diverge even when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=10^{-6}$
\end_inset

 (using an efficient and numerically robust implementation found in common
 stiff methods for ODEs

In addition to testing efficiency, we used this to test the stiffness detection
 in SOSRA2.
 Using a safety factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=5$
\end_inset

, we added only two lines of code to make the algorithm print out the timings
 for which the algorithm predicts stiffness.
 The results on two trajectories were computed and are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Stiffness-detection-in-additive"

\end_inset

.
 The authors note that the stiffness detection algorithms are surprisingly
 robust without any tweaking being done and are shown to not give almost
 any false positives nor false negatives on this test problem.
 While this safety factor is set somewhat high in comparison to traditional
 ODE stiffness detection, we note that these algorithms were designed to
 efficiently handle mild stiffness and thus we see it as a benefit that
 they only declare stiffness when it appears to be in the regime which is
 more suitable for implicit methods.

 SOSRI2, and the fixed time step Euler-Maruyama and a Runge-Kutta Milstein
 schemes for Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin{align}

\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$

 As with Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 does not have an analytical solution so a reference solution was computed
 using a low tolerance solution via SOSRI for each Brownian trajectory.
 The results show that there is a minimal difference in efficiency between
 the SRI algorithms for errors over the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[10^{-6},10^{-2}\right]$
\end_inset

, while these algorithms are all significantly more efficient than the lower
 order algorithms when the required error is 
\begin_inset Formula $<10^{-2}$
\end_inset

 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:SOSRI-efficiency"

\end_inset

A-D).
 The weak error work-precision diagrams show that when using between 100
 to 10,000 trajectories, the weak error is less than the sample error in
 the regime where there is no discernible efficiency difference between
 the SRI methods.These results show that in the regime of mild accuracy on
 non-stiff equations, these methods are much more efficient than low order
 methods yet achieve the same efficiency as the non-stability optimized
 SRI variants.
 Note that these results also show the conservativeness of the error estimators.

To test the real consequences of the enhanced stability, we use the Epithelial-M
esenchymal Transition (EMT) model of 19 pathwise stiff reaction equations
 introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3358"

\end_inset

, studied as a numerical test in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RN3787"

\end_inset

, and written in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transitio"

\end_inset

.
 In the previous work it was noted that 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 was a less stiff version of this model.
 Thus we first tested the speed that the methods could solve for 10,000
 trajectories with no failures due to numerical instabilities.
 The tolerances were tuned for each method by factors of 2 and finding the
 largest values that were stable.
 Since SOSRI demonstrated that its stability is much higher than even SOSRI2,
 we show the effect of tolerance changes on SOSRI as well.
 The results show that at similar tolerances the SOSRI method takes nearly
 the same amount of time as SRIW1 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:SRI-times-for-Oval2"

\end_inset

).
 However, there is an upper bound on the tolerances before the adaptivity
 is no longer able to help keep the method stable.
 For SRIW1, this bound is much lower, causing it to run more than 15x slower
 than the fastest SOSRI setup.
 Interestingly SOSRI2 required a higher tolerance than SRIW1 but was 3x
 faster than SRIW1's fastest setup.
 We note that SOSRI's highest relative tolerance 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{-7}\approx7\times10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 is essentially requiring 4 digits of accuracy (in strong error) when considerin
g the conservativeness of the error estimator, which is far beyond the accuracy
 necessary in many cases.
 Lastly, we note that the SOSRI method is able to solve for 10,000 stable
 trajectories more than 60x faster than any of the tested fixed time step
 methods.

We then timed the run time to solve 10 trajectories in the

\end_inset

 case (Table

\end_inset

).
 This time we found the optimal tolerance in terms of powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

.
 Once again, SRIW1 needed a lower tolerance than is necessary in order to
 stay stable.
 SOSRI is able to solve the problem only asking for around 2 digits of accuracy,
 while the others require more (especially in absolute tolerance as there
 is a stiff reactant whose values travel close to zero).
 One interesting point to note is that at similar tolerances both SOSRI
 and SOSRI2 receive similar timings and both over 6 times faster than the
 fastest SRIW1 tolerance setup.
 Both are nearly twice as fast as SRIW1 when matching tolerances as well.
 Given the conservativeness of the error estimators generally being around
 2 orders of magnitude more precise than the local error estimate, the low
 tolerance solutions are accurate enough for many phenomenological experiments
 and thus present a good speedup over previous methods.
 The timings for Euler-Maruyama and Runge-Kutta Milstein schemes are omitted
 since the tests were unable to finish.
 From the results of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 we note that the average 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 for SRIW1 on the edge of its stability had that the smallest 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 was approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-11}$
\end_inset

.
 The stability region for fixed step-size Euler-Maruyama is strictly smaller
 than SRIW1 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SOSRI-Stability-Regions."

\end_inset

) which suggests that it would require around 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times10^{12}$
\end_inset

 time steps (with Runge-Kutta Milstein being similar) to solve to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=500$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, given it takes on our setup extrapolating the time given 170 seconds
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{20}$
\end_inset

 steps, this projects to around 
\begin_inset Formula $1.6\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 seconds, or approximately 5 years.

 The model was solved nearly to steady state on the PDE described by the

 Starting from the ODE steady state, noise was added to the gradient by
 solving the extension to an SPDE with multiplicative noise on

 Each of the methods solved the problem at the highest tolerance possible

 Since this problem starts from the only positive steady state, it is only
 semi-stiff.
 Yet we receive similar results as the other problems with the SOSRI methods
 able to compute steady state stochastic gradients nearly 6x faster than
 SRIW1, signaling that the expanded stability domain can lead to speedups
 against other high order SRK methods even to equations which only exhibit
 slight amounts of stiffness.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we derived stability-optimized SRK methods for additive and
 diagonal noise equations, and used a transformation to allow the additive
 noise methods to solve affine noise problems.
 Many other equations can be reduced to the additive noise case as well
 using the same means.
 Importantly, our derivation methods utilized heavy computational tools
 in order to approximately optimize otherwise intractable equations.
 This same method of derivation can easily be scaled up to higher orders,
 and by incorporating the coefficients for higher conditions, efficiency
 can be optimized as well by adding the norm of the principle error coefficients
 to the optimization function.
 We note that the majority of the search was performed using global optimizers
 in massive parallel using a hand-optimized CUDA kernel for the numerical
 integral of the characteristic function, replacing man-hours with core-hours
 and effectively optimizing the method.
 The clear next steps are to find SRA and SRI methods with minimal error
 estimates and sensible stability regions for the cases in which lower strong
 error matters, and similar optimizations on SRK methods developed for small
 noise problems.
 We note that high strong order methods were investigated because of their
 better trajectory-wise convergence, allowing for a more robust solution
 and error estimation since our application to transiently pathwise stiff
 equations requires such properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we also derived L-stable methods for additive (and thus multiplicat
ive and affine) noise equations, and computationally could not find an A-B-L
 stable method.
 While our method does not prove that no 2-stage A-B-L method exists, we
 have at least drastically narrowed down its possibility.
 Additionally an extension of a well-known ESDIRK method to additive noise
 was developed.
 This method has an implicit-explicit (IMEX) extension and the stochastic
 extension was compatible with both tableaus.
 We showed that this IMEX version of the method could numerically converge
 at order 2.0 on a test problem (matching the other SRA methods), indicating
 that it may achieve the sufficient condition.
 As an adaptive high order IMEX method, the ODE version of the method is
 a common choice for large discretizations of PDEs.
 Thus this method presents itself as a potentially automatic and efficient
 option for discretizations of large affine noise SPDEs by being able to
 use a low number of time steps while minimizing the amount of work required
 to solve the implicit equation.
 More work could compare this method to other implicit solvers for additive
 noise SDEs to determine the problem domain which is is efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our timings show that the current high order SRK methods are stability-bound
 and that when scientific studies are only looking for small amounts of
 accuracy in stochastic simulations, most of the computational effort is
 lost to generating more accurate than necessary solutions in order to satisfy
 stability constraints.
 For additive noise problems we were able to obtain solutions about 20x-60x
 faster and for diagonal noise approximately 6x than the current adaptive
 methods (SRA1, SRA3, SRIW1), while common methods like Euler-Maruyama and
 Drift-Implicit 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 Runge-Kutta Milstein were 100x slower or in many cases could not even finish.
 We have also shown that these methods are very robust even at high tolerances
 and have a tendency to produce the correct qualitative results on semi-stiff
 equations (via plots) even when the user chosen accuracy is low.
 Given that the required user input is minimal, we see these as very strong
 candidates for default general purpose solvers for problem-solving environments
 such as MATLAB and Julia since they can easily and efficiently produce
 results which are sufficiently correct.
 We note that the SOSRA and SOSRA2 methods are not as efficient at low tolerance
s as SRA3, so SRA3 should be used when high accuracy is necessary (on additive
 or affine noise problems).
 However, in many cases like integrating to find steady distributions of
 bistable parameter regimes or generating trajectories of phonomenological
 models, this ability to quickly get a more course estimate is valuable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that the stiffness detection in SDEs is a novel addition which we
 have demonstrated can act very robustly.
 It has a control parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 which can be used to control the false positive and false negative rate
 as needed.
 Note that stiff methods can achieve similar largest eigenvalue estimates
 directly from the Jacobians of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 (and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

) given that the methods are implicit (or in the case of Rosenbrock methods,
 the Jacobian must still be computed), and thus this can be paired with
 a stiff solver to allow for automatic switching between stiff and non-stiff
 solvers.
 Given that the cost for such stiffness checks is minimal, we are interested
 in future studies on the efficiency of such methods due to the stochastic
 nature of stiffness in SDEs.

 The boundary conditions were no-flex on every side except the right side
 which had leaky boundary conditions with parameter
